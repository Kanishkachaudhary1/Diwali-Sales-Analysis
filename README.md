 Project Title: Diwali Sales Data Analysis
 
📝 Project Description:
This project is a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a retail dataset focusing on Diwali sales, using Python and key libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The goal is to extract business insights related to customer behavior, product demand, and regional sales performance.

✅ Key Steps and Tasks:
Data Import and Cleaning:
Loaded the dataset from a CSV file using Pandas.
Removed unnecessary columns (Status, unnamed1) and null values in the Amount column.
Changed the data type of the Amount column to integer for accurate analysis.

Data Exploration:

Explored the dataset using .info() and .describe() to understand its structure and basic statistics.
Renamed columns for readability (e.g., Marital_Status to Shaadi).
Univariate and Bivariate Analysis:

Gender Analysis:
Found that females made more purchases and had higher sales contributions.

Age Group Analysis:
The 26-35 age group, especially females, were the top buyers in terms of both number of orders and total amount spent.

State-wise Analysis:
Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka were the leading states in terms of both number of orders and sales revenue.

Marital Status Analysis:
Single women showed higher spending behavior.

Occupation Analysis:
Most purchases came from people working in IT, Aviation, and similar fields.

Product Category Analysis:
Top categories were Food, Clothing, and Apparel.

Top Products:
Identified the Top 10 most sold products using order count.

📊 Visualizations Used:
Count plots for Gender, Age Group, Marital Status, Occupation, and Product Categories.
Bar plots for state-wise orders and revenue.
Horizontal and vertical bar charts for top product sales.

📈 Business Insights:
Target marketing campaigns towards females aged 26–35, especially in UP, Maharashtra, and Karnataka.
Stock and promote high-performing categories like Food, Clothing, and Apparel during festive seasons.
